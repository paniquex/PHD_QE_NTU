**<ins>Lessons I learned from preparing my QE</ins>:**
1) When you prepare the question list for you QE draft, try to use more questions like: "Why? How?" instead of "What?".
2) Figures are the key. Please refer to this section from Prof Chng's website. It is really useful: [link](https://aseschng.github.io/GraduateStudents.html#GraduateStudents_Writing)
3) The primary goal of **your presentation** is to convey the key concepts of your contribution. Avoid going too deep into technical details -- keep those for the QE report, not the presentation. Instead, focus on explaining **the main ideas**.
4) Do not forget to show the qualitative examples (audios/text/pictures) of your method and compare to previous approaches.
5) Do not forget to include future work directions.
